[![Patches Check](https://github.com/TheSillyOk/kernel_ls_patches/actions/workflows/patches-check.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TheSillyOk/kernel_ls_patches/actions/workflows/patches-check.yml)

Personal patches used when building in https://github.com/TheSillyOk/kernel_workflows

Not all patches are my own, credit might be found in commit messages (no guarantees).

BEWARE OF FORCE PUSHES. I do lots of mistakes, I don't like doing hundreds of fix commits.
